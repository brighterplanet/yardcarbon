CARBON FOOTPRINT DROP-IN CODE FOR EY CLOUD DASHBOARD
----------------------------------------------------
By Brighter Planet, For EngineYard, Our Favorite PaaS

We're basing it off how you guys do the "HTTP Monitoring" lightbox in "More Options." Check out doc/popup.png for how it should look.

What you'll find in this repo:
 * 1 new route - /environments/XYZ/carbon_footprint
 * 1 new action - CarbonFootprintsController#show
 * 1 new view file - app/views/carbon_footprints/show.js.erb
 * 1 new javascript file - public/javascripts/Carbon.js

The javascript makes an API call like:

http://carbon.brighterplanet.com/computations.json?carrier=amazon&instance_class=c1.xlarge&duration=2700000&region=us-east-1a

...or in HTML format for human consumption...

http://carbon.brighterplanet.com/computations.html?carrier=amazon&instance_class=c1.xlarge&duration=2700000&region=us-east-1a

No customer or personally-identifiable information is sent or stored. It's all client-side javascript.

Any questions, please call Andy (x302) or Seamus (x305) on our main line (802) 458-0441.
